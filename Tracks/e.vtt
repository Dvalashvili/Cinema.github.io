something nice from me.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.329
I already did.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.397
And?

12:11.497 --> 12:12.998
Oh, it was very nice.

12:13.098 --> 12:16.335
Yeah.
Very tasteful.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

12:16.935 --> 12:19.205
You're welcome,
Miss Potts.

12:22.340 --> 12:23.342
Okay.

12:41.893 --> 12:45.364
You're good. Oh, I thought
I lost you back there.

12:45.864 --> 12:50.002
You did, sir.
I had to cut
across Mulholland.

12:50.268 --> 12:51.537
I got you.
I got you.

12:53.239 --> 12:54.807

I got caught doing a piece
for<i> Vanity Fair.</i>

12:57.109 --> 12:59.044

For three hours
you got me standing here.

Nothing.

13:15.060 --> 13:17.196
Come on, sour patch.
Don't be mad.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.065
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

13:20.165 --> 13:21.467
I said I was sorry.
Good morning, Mr. Stark.

13:21.567 --> 13:22.868
You don't need to
apologize to me.
I'm your man.

13:22.968 --> 13:23.735
Hi. I told him
I was sorry, but he...

13:23.969 --> 13:25.337
I'm just
indifferent right now.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.371
You don't respect yourself,

13:26.571 --> 13:28.107

don't respect me.
I respect you.

13:28.207 --> 13:29.274

I'll get you a bottle, okay?

sashimi without sake.
You are constitutionally

13:42.087 --> 13:43.556

It would be
irresponsible not to drink.

I don't want any.

talking about.

and I'm putting on my uniform,

13:55.434 --> 13:56.802
you know what I recognize?

13:57.069 --> 14:02.474
I see in that mirror that
every person that's got this
uniform on got my back!

Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you.
I'm not cut out...

No, no. You don't
have to be like me!

I humbly present
the crown jewel

49:09.312 --> 49:12.215
I don't understand why...<i>
Get down here. I need you.</i>

49:19.522 --> 49:20.557
Hey.

49:22.592 --> 49:25.228
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.

49:25.328 --> 49:26.296
Let's see them.

49:26.562 --> 49:28.632
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

49:29.366 --> 49:32.202
I just need your
help for a sec.

49:32.835 --> 49:35.205
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

49:35.305 --> 49:37.708
It was.
It is now an antique.

49:38.375 --> 49:41.378
This is what will
be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

49:41.478 --> 49:43.447
I'm swapping it up
for an upgraded unit,

49:43.547 --> 49:45.716
and I just ran into
a little speed bump.

49:46.149 --> 49:47.651
Speed bump,
what does that mean?

49:47.751 --> 49:49.186
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

49:49.286 --> 49:52.522
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

49:52.622 --> 49:55.692
And it's contacting the
socket wall and causing
a little bit of a short.

49:55.792 --> 49:57.494
It's fine.

49:58.228 --> 50:00.364
What do you want me to do?
Put that on
the table over there.

50:00.464 --> 50:01.865
That is irrelevant.
Oh, my God!

50:01.998 --> 50:06.570
I want you to reach in,
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.

50:07.203 --> 50:09.439
Is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine.

50:09.539 --> 50:11.241
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

50:11.341 --> 50:12.576
the socket wall
or it goes "beep."

50:12.676 --> 50:13.710
What do you mean,
"Operation"?

50:13.810 --> 50:15.245
It's just a game,
never mind.

50:15.345 --> 50:19.349
Just gently lift the wire.
Okay? Great.
Okay.

50:21.217 --> 50:23.587
You know,
I don't think that I'm
qualified to do this.

50:23.687 --> 50:27.691
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable,
qualified,

50:27.791 --> 50:31.395
trustworthy person
I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

50:32.429 --> 50:34.564
Is it too much of
a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

50:34.664 --> 50:37.401
Okay, okay.
I really need your help here.

50:37.501 --> 50:38.568
Okay.

50:42.805 --> 50:44.107
Oh, there's pus!

50:44.273 --> 50:49.279
It's not pus.
It's an inorganic plasmic
discharge from the device,

50:49.379 --> 50:51.281
not from my body.
It smells!

50:51.381 --> 50:52.783
Yeah, it does.

50:53.049 --> 50:54.484
The copper wire.

50:54.584 --> 50:55.819
The copper wire,
you got it?

50:55.919 --> 50:57.187
Okay, I got it! I got it!
Okay, you got it?

you're coming out!

51:00.290 --> 51:01.024
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

51:01.324 --> 51:02.192
That's what
I was trying to
tell you before.

51:02.659 --> 51:04.761
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull
it out, you don't...

51:04.861 --> 51:06.730
There's a magnet
at the end of it!
That was it.

51:06.830 --> 51:07.597
(RAPID BEEPING)
You just pulled it out.

51:07.697 --> 51:08.598
Oh, God!
Okay, I was not expecting...

51:09.132 --> 51:11.368
Don't put it back in!
Don't put it back in!
Okay, what do I do?

51:11.468 --> 51:12.268
What's wrong?

51:13.236 --> 51:14.404
Nothing, I'm just going into
cardiac arrest 'cause you
yanked it out like a trout...

51:14.671 --> 51:18.208
What? You said it was safe!
We gotta hurry.
Take this. Take this.

51:18.308 --> 51:20.277
You gotta switch
it out really quick.
Okay. Okay.

51:20.510 --> 51:22.345
Tony? It's going to be okay.
What?

51:22.445 --> 51:23.212
Is it?
It's gonna be okay.

51:23.379 --> 51:26.216
I'm gonna make this okay.
Let's hope.

51:26.616 --> 51:30.720
Okay, you're gonna attach
that to the base plate.
Make sure you...

51:34.790 --> 51:37.294
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?

51:37.394 --> 51:39.129
Here, I got it.
I got it. Here.

51:39.562 --> 51:40.597
Nice.

51:40.697 --> 51:42.866
Are you okay?
Yeah, I feel great.

anything like that
ever again.

anyone but you.

to do with this?

52:07.891 --> 52:09.392
That?

52:10.226 --> 52:11.528
Destroy it.

52:11.961 --> 52:13.563
Incinerate it.

doing on top of my desk?

52:28.845 --> 52:32.149
That's my phone,
that's a picture
of me and my dad.

RHODES:
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

52:45.762 --> 52:47.864
I'll tell you,
in my experience,

52:47.964 --> 52:52.769
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,

52:53.035 --> 52:54.036
his insight,

52:54.270 --> 52:57.541
that ability to look
into a situation
beyond the obvious

52:57.641 --> 53:01.311
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

53:01.411 --> 53:02.445
Colonel?

53:02.545 --> 53:04.381
Why not a pilot
without the plane?

53:04.481 --> 53:06.449
Look who fell
out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

53:06.549 --> 53:08.451
Hello, sir.
Speaking of
manned or unmanned,

53:08.551 --> 53:10.387
you gotta get him
to tell you about the
time he guessed wrong

53:10.487 --> 53:12.956
at spring break.
Just remember that,
spring break, 1987.

53:13.056 --> 53:14.457
That lovely lady
you woke up with.
Don't do that!

53:14.557 --> 53:15.825
What was his name?
Don't do that.

53:15.925 --> 53:16.960
Was it Ivan?
Don't do that.

53:17.060 --> 53:18.395
They'll believe it.
Don't do that.

53:18.495 --> 53:19.396
Okay.
Don't do that.

53:19.829 --> 53:22.666
Pleasure meeting you.
Give us a couple minutes,
you guys.

Why?

I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

53:30.073 --> 53:31.942
I'm doing a little
better than walking.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.577
Really?
Yeah.

53:34.144 --> 53:36.846
Rhodey, I'm working on
something big.

53:36.979 --> 53:39.950
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

53:40.917 --> 53:43.687
You're about to make
a whole lot of people
around here real happy,

53:43.787 --> 53:46.756
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

53:46.856 --> 53:48.525
that was a doozy.

53:48.825 --> 53:53.430
This is not for the military.
I'm not... It's different.

53:53.530 --> 53:56.233
What? You're
a humanitarian now
or something?

53:56.333 --> 53:57.634
I need you to listen to me.
No.

53:57.734 --> 54:01.605
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

54:03.506 --> 54:04.975
I'm serious.
Okay.

54:07.943 --> 54:10.247
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

54:10.347 --> 54:11.481
Thanks.

<i> Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries
Central Database?</i>

54:32.268 --> 54:34.804
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

54:34.904 --> 54:36.506
Till further notice,
why don't we just
keep everything

54:36.606 --> 54:37.507

a secret project,
are we, sir?</i>

54:44.513 --> 54:47.617
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

54:49.719 --> 54:52.322
Maybe in mine,
it can actually
do some good.

like me to tell him?
Great. I'll be right up.

Okay.

57:37.753 --> 57:39.823
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

57:39.923 --> 57:40.690
It is.

57:41.124 --> 57:44.928
This is a flight stabilizer.

you have posttraumatic stress.

They want to lock you out.

dipped 40 points?

gotta give me something.

You mind if I send
you on an errand?

I need you to
go to my office.

01:28:41.348 --> 01:28:43.885
You're going to hack
into the mainframe and
you're going to retrieve all

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:46.654
the recent

This is a lock chip.

It's probably
under Executive Files.

If not,
they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:55.330
to look for the lowest
numeric heading.

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.932

do with this information
if I bring it back here?

you know that
I would help you
with anything,

01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:14.682
but I cannot help you
if you're going to start
all of this again.

I'm not going
to be a part of it.

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:50.585

Okay, sir, and that's what
we're trying to do, but
honestly, it's impossible.

01:48:39.745 --> 01:48:42.048

look into it.</i>

01:48:53.793 --> 01:48:55.028
<i> JARVIS: Two percent.</i>

01:48:57.129 --> 01:48:59.733
<i> We are now running
on emergency backup power.</i>

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:00.800
Whoa!

01:49:11.744 --> 01:49:15.115
Potts!
Tony! Oh, my God,
are you okay?

01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:19.319
I'm almost out of power.
I've got to get out of this
thing. I'll be right there.

01:49:19.419 --> 01:49:20.887
<i> Nice try!</i>

01:49:22.021 --> 01:49:23.590
(GRUNTS)

01:49:33.366 --> 01:49:35.235
TONY: Weapons status?

01:49:35.335 --> 01:49:37.671
<i> JARVIS:
Repulsors offline.

01:49:41.874 --> 01:49:43.310

01:49:49.215 --> 01:49:50.650
(GROANING)

01:49:51.917 --> 01:49:53.987
<i> Very clever, Tony.</i>

01:49:59.225 --> 01:50:01.828
Potts?
Tony!

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:02.662
This isn't working.

01:50:03.329 --> 01:50:05.165
We're going to have to
overload the reactor
and blast the roof.

01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:06.766
Well, how are you
going to do that?

01:50:06.866 --> 01:50:07.933
You're going to do it.

01:50:08.033 --> 01:50:10.770
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:12.172
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:14.908
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

01:50:15.008 --> 01:50:16.309
It's going to fry
everything up here.

01:50:18.444 --> 01:50:20.880
Okay. I'm going in now.

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:24.150
Make sure you wait
till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

01:50:33.759 --> 01:50:35.395
<i> TONY: This looks important!</i>

01:50:56.315 --> 01:50:59.152
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,

01:50:59.252 --> 01:51:03.323
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

01:51:11.731 --> 01:51:14.134
You finally
outdid yourself, Tony!

01:51:16.402 --> 01:51:18.738
You'd have made
your father proud!

01:51:23.509 --> 01:51:26.112
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:33.687
(GROANING)

01:51:33.887 --> 01:51:34.888

01:51:45.531 --> 01:51:47.000
PEPPER: Tony!

01:51:48.167 --> 01:51:49.869
How ironic, Tony!

01:51:51.504 --> 01:51:54.007
Trying to rid
the world of weapons,

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.743
you gave it
its best one ever!

01:51:56.843 --> 01:52:02.749
Pepper!
And now I'm going
to kill you with it!

01:52:05.785 --> 01:52:07.987
You ripped out my
targeting system!

01:52:08.087 --> 01:52:09.456
Time to hit the button!

01:52:09.556 --> 01:52:11.458
You told me not to!

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:13.727
Hold still,
you little prick!

01:52:15.561 --> 01:52:16.963
Just do it!

01:52:17.063 --> 01:52:18.198
You'll die!

01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:22.902
Push it!

01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:33.046
(SCREAMING)

01:53:20.359 --> 01:53:22.195
PEPPER: Tony!

01:53:30.536 --> 01:53:32.806
<i> You've all received
the official statement
of what occurred</i>

01:53:32.906 --> 01:53:35.141
<i> at Stark Industries
last night.</i>

01:53:35.407 --> 01:53:40.013
<i> There have been unconfirmed
reports that a robotic
prototype malfunctioned</i>

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:42.582
<i> and caused damage
to the arc reactor.</i>

01:53:43.182 --> 01:53:45.585
<i> Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's
personal security staff...</i>

01:53:45.685 --> 01:53:47.587
"Iron Man."
That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

01:53:47.687 --> 01:53:49.222
I mean, it's not
technically accurate.

01:53:49.322 --> 01:53:51.357
The suit's
a gold-titanium alloy,

01:53:51.457 --> 01:53:54.160
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:55.929
Here's your alibi.

01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:57.897
Okay.

01:53:57.997 --> 01:54:00.099
You were on your yacht.
Yeah.

01:54:00.199 --> 01:54:02.235
We have port papers
that put you in
Avalon all night,

01:54:02.335 --> 01:54:03.703
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

01:54:03.803 --> 01:54:07.240
See, I was thinking
maybe we should say
it was just Pepper and me

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.175
alone on the island.

01:54:10.409 --> 01:54:11.845
That's what happened.
All right.

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:14.013
Just read it,
word for word.

01:54:15.915 --> 01:54:17.951
There's nothing
about Stane here.

01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:20.854
That's being handled.
He's on vacation.

01:54:21.554 --> 01:54:24.123
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.

01:54:24.223 --> 01:54:26.593
But what about
the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:29.562
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy,
don't you think?

01:54:29.662 --> 01:54:32.098
This isn't
my first rodeo,
Mr. Stark.

01:54:32.198 --> 01:54:33.399
Just stick to
the official statement,

01:54:33.499 --> 01:54:36.135
and soon,
this will all
be behind you.

01:54:36.235 --> 01:54:38.438
You've got 90 seconds.

01:54:41.006 --> 01:54:42.542
Oh, Agent Coulson?

01:54:43.409 --> 01:54:48.181
I just wanted to say
thank you very much
for all of your help.

01:54:48.281 --> 01:54:51.217
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

01:54:51.417 --> 01:54:53.086
From the Strategic Homeland...

01:54:53.186 --> 01:54:54.654
Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:54:55.187 --> 01:54:56.322
Right.

01:54:57.089 --> 01:54:58.892
Let's get this
show on the road.

01:54:58.992 --> 01:55:01.194
You know,
it's actually
not that bad.

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:03.496
Even I don't think
I'm Iron Man.

01:55:03.596 --> 01:55:05.231
You're not Iron Man.
Am so.

01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:07.667
You're not.
All right,
suit yourself.

01:55:07.767 --> 01:55:11.905
You know, if I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.

01:55:12.005 --> 01:55:13.339
She'd be a wreck,
'cause she'd always
be worrying

01:55:13.439 --> 01:55:14.440
that I was going to die,

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:17.010
yet so proud of
the man I'd become.

01:55:17.110 --> 01:55:20.647
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:22.348
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:55:22.448 --> 01:55:23.248
crazy about me.

01:55:23.415 --> 01:55:25.285
Tell me you never
think about that night.

01:55:25.385 --> 01:55:27.253
What night?
You know.

01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:35.995
Are you talking about
the night that we danced
and went up on the roof,

01:55:37.529 --> 01:55:43.202
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

01:55:43.302 --> 01:55:46.472
and you left me there,
by myself?

01:55:47.639 --> 01:55:50.276
Is that the night
you're talking about?

01:55:50.376 --> 01:55:51.344
Mmm-hmm.

01:55:52.411 --> 01:55:53.479
Thought so.

01:55:56.248 --> 01:56:00.053
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Yes, that will be all,
Miss Potts.

01:56:00.153 --> 01:56:03.523
<i> And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.</i>

01:56:03.623 --> 01:56:06.659
<i> He will not be
taking any questions.
Thank you.</i>

01:56:10.796 --> 01:56:13.266
<i> Been a while since
I was in front of you.</i>

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:15.001

<i> on the freeway
and the rooftop...</i>

01:56:22.708 --> 01:56:25.278
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark,
but do you honestly
expect us to believe that

01:56:25.378 --> 01:56:29.148
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that
conveniently appeared,

01:56:29.248 --> 01:56:32.318
despite the fact that you...<i>
I know that it's confusing.</i>

01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:36.089
<i> It is one thing to question
the official story,
and another thing entirely</i>

01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:39.359
<i> to make wild accusations,
or insinuate
that I'm a superhero.</i>

01:56:39.459 --> 01:56:41.127
I never said
you were a superhero.

01:56:41.227 --> 01:56:41.961
<i> Didn't?</i>
Mmm-mmm.

01:56:42.695 --> 01:56:46.466

because that would be
outlandish and fantastic.</i>

You think you're the only

Mr. Stark,
you've become part
of a bigger universe.

02:05:32.157 --> 02:05:33.959
You just don't
know it yet.
