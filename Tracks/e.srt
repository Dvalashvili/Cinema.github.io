00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:26,296
Let's see them.

681
00:49:26,562 --> 00:49:28,632
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

682
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,202
I just need your
help for a sec.

683
00:49:32,835 --> 00:49:35,205
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

684
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,708
It was.
It is now an antique.

685
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,378
This is what will
be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

686
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,447
I'm swapping it up
for an upgraded unit,

687
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,716
and I just ran into
a little speed bump.

688
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,651
Speed bump,
what does that mean?

689
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,186
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

690
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:52,522
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

691
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,692
And it's contacting the
socket wall and causing
a little bit of a short.

692
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,494
It's fine.

693
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,364
What do you want me to do?
Put that on
the table over there.

694
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:01,865
That is irrelevant.
Oh, my God!

695
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:06,570
I want you to reach in,
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.

696
00:50:07,203 --> 00:50:09,439
Is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine.

697
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,241
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

698
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,576
the socket wall
or it goes "beep."

699
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,710
What do you mean,
"Operation"?

700
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,245
It's just a game,
never mind.

701
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,349
Just gently lift the wire.
Okay? Great.
Okay.

702
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:23,587
You know,
I don't think that I'm
qualified to do this.

703
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,691
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable,
qualified,

704
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,395
trustworthy person
I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

705
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,564
Is it too much of
a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

706
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:37,401
Okay, okay.
I really need your help here.

707
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:38,568
Okay.

708
00:50:42,805 --> 00:50:44,107
Oh, there's pus!

709
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:49,279
It's not pus.
It's an inorganic plasmic
discharge from the device,

710
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,281
not from my body.
It smells!

711
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,783
Yeah, it does.

712
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,484

713
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:55,819

714
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:57,187
Okay, I got it! I got it!
Okay, you got it?

715
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,021

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

718
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:02,192
That's what
I was trying to
tell you before.

719
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,761
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull
it out, you don't...

720

at the end of it!

We gotta hurry.
Take this. Take this.

You gotta switch
it out really quick.
Okay. Okay.

728
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,345
Tony? It's going to be okay.
What?

729
00:51:22,445 --> 00:51:23,212
Is it?
It's gonna be okay.

I'm gonna make this okay.

that to the base plate.

in my experience,

757
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:52,769
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,

that ability to look
into a situation
beyond the obvious

760
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:01,311

Speaking of

you gotta get him
to tell you about the
time he guessed wrong

766
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,956

Just remember that,
spring break, 1987.

Don't do that.

better than walking.

I'm not... It's different.

a humanitarian now

I need you to listen to me.
No.

to get your mind right.

Hold still,
you little prick!

1503
01:52:15,561 --> 01:52:16,963
Just do it!

1504
01:52:17,063 --> 01:52:18,198
You'll die!

1505
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,902
Push it!

1506
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:33,046
(SCREAMING)

1507
01:53:20,359 --> 01:53:22,195
PEPPER: Tony!

1508
01:53:30,536 --> 01:53:32,806
<i> You've all received
 the official statement
 of what occurred</i>

1509
01:53:32,906 --> 01:53:35,141
<i> at Stark Industries
 last night.</i>

1510
01:53:35,407 --> 01:53:40,013
<i> There have been unconfirmed
 reports that a robotic
 prototype malfunctioned</i>

1511
01:53:40,113 --> 01:53:42,582
<i> and caused damage
 to the arc reactor.</i>

1512
01:53:43,182 --> 01:53:45,585
<i> Fortunately, a member
 of Tony Stark's
 personal security staff...</i>

1513
01:53:45,685 --> 01:53:47,587
"Iron Man."
That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1514
01:53:47,687 --> 01:53:49,222
I mean, it's not
technically accurate.

1515
01:53:49,322 --> 01:53:51,357
The suit's
a gold-titanium alloy,

1516
01:53:51,457 --> 01:53:54,160
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1517
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:55,929
Here's your alibi.

1518
01:53:56,629 --> 01:53:57,897
Okay.

1519
01:53:57,997 --> 01:54:00,099
You were on your yacht.
Yeah.

1520
01:54:00,199 --> 01:54:02,235
We have port papers
that put you in
Avalon all night,

1521
01:54:02,335 --> 01:54:03,703
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1522
01:54:03,803 --> 01:54:07,240
See, I was thinking
maybe we should say
it was just Pepper and me

1523
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:09,175
alone on the island.

1524
01:54:10,409 --> 01:54:11,845
That's what happened.
All right.

1525
01:54:11,945 --> 01:54:14,013
Just read it,
word for word.

1526
01:54:15,915 --> 01:54:17,951
There's nothing
about Stane here.

1527
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:20,854
That's being handled.
He's on vacation.

1528
01:54:21,554 --> 01:54:24,123
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.

1529
01:54:24,223 --> 01:54:26,593
But what about
the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1530
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:29,562
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy,
don't you think?

1531
01:54:29,662 --> 01:54:32,098
This isn't
my first rodeo,
Mr. Stark.

1532
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:33,399
Just stick to
the official statement,

1533
01:54:33,499 --> 01:54:36,135
and soon,
this will all
be behind you.

1534
01:54:36,235 --> 01:54:38,438
You've got 90 seconds.

1535
01:54:41,006 --> 01:54:42,542
Oh, Agent Coulson?

1536
01:54:43,409 --> 01:54:48,181
I just wanted to say
thank you very much
for all of your help.

1537
01:54:48,281 --> 01:54:51,217
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1538
01:54:51,417 --> 01:54:53,086
From the Strategic Homeland...

1539
01:54:53,186 --> 01:54:54,654
Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1540
01:54:55,187 --> 01:54:56,322
Right.

1541
01:54:57,089 --> 01:54:58,892
Let's get this
show on the road.

1542
01:54:58,992 --> 01:55:01,194
You know,
it's actually
not that bad.

1543
01:55:01,294 --> 01:55:03,496
Even I don't think
I'm Iron Man.

1544
01:55:03,596 --> 01:55:05,231
You're not Iron Man.
Am so.

1545
01:55:05,331 --> 01:55:07,667
You're not.
All right,
suit yourself.

1546
01:55:07,767 --> 01:55:11,905
You know, if I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.

1547
01:55:12,005 --> 01:55:13,339
She'd be a wreck,
'cause she'd always
be worrying

1548
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:14,440
that I was going to die,

1549
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:17,010
yet so proud of
the man I'd become.

1550
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:20,647
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1551
01:55:21,347 --> 01:55:22,348
(CLEARS THROAT)

1552
01:55:22,448 --> 01:55:23,248
crazy about me.

1553
01:55:23,415 --> 01:55:25,285
Tell me you never
think about that night.

1554
01:55:25,385 --> 01:55:27,253
What night?
You know.

1555
01:55:30,189 --> 01:55:35,995
Are you talking about
the night that we danced
and went up on the roof,

1556
01:55:37,529 --> 01:55:43,202
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1557
01:55:43,302 --> 01:55:46,472
and you left me there,
by myself?

1558
01:55:47,639 --> 01:55:50,276
Is that the night
you're talking about?

1559
01:55:50,376 --> 01:55:51,344
Mmm-hmm.

1560
01:55:52,411 --> 01:55:53,479
Thought so.

1561
01:55:56,248 --> 01:56:00,053
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Yes, that will be all,
Miss Potts.

1562
01:56:00,153 --> 01:56:03,523
<i> And now, Mr. Stark has
 prepared a statement.</i>

1563
01:56:03,623 --> 01:56:06,659
<i> He will not be
 taking any questions.
 Thank you.</i>

1564
01:56:10,796 --> 01:56:13,266
<i> Been a while since
 I was in front of you.</i>

1565
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:15,001
<i> I figure I'll stick
 to the cards this time.</i>

<i> on the freeway
 and the rooftop...</i>

1570
01:56:22,708 --> 01:56:25,278
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark,
but do you honestly
expect us to believe that

1571
01:56:25,378 --> 01:56:29,148
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that
conveniently appeared,

1572
01:56:29,248 --> 01:56:32,318
despite the fact that you...<i>
 I know that it's confusing.</i>

1573
01:56:32,418 --> 01:56:36,089
<i> It is one thing to question
 the official story,
 and another thing entirely</i>

1574
01:56:36,189 --> 01:56:39,359
<i> to make wild accusations,
 or insinuate
 that I'm a superhero.</i>

1575
01:56:39,459 --> 01:56:41,127
I never said
you were a superhero.

1576
01:56:41,227 --> 01:56:41,961
<i> Didn't?</i>
Mmm-mmm.

1577
01:56:42,695 --> 01:56:46,466
<i> Well, good,
 because that would be
 outlandish and fantastic.</i>

of a bigger universe.
