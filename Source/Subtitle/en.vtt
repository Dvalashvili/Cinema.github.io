WEBVTT

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.139
We shouldn't be here when it gets dark.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.735
Set the trap
at the mouth of the cave, please.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.161
You need a doctor?

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.206
I am a doctor.

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.627
It's impressive, don't you think？

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.003
Vampire bats weigh almost nothing,

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:34.340
but they can down a creature
nearly ten times their size.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.185
What are you using as bait?

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:47.604
You volunteering?

00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:49.188
Leaving.

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:53.067
Pay me now.

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:55.612
Before the sun goes down.

00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:06.956
You throw in that bushcrafter
on your belt and we have a deal.

00:04:56.255 --> 00:04:57.256
Come on.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.351
Move!

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.584
Should be able
to take better care of you here.

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.758
Everyone's here to help you.

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:45.555
Michael, this is Lucian. Lucian, Michael.

00:05:45.638 --> 00:05:48.015
Michael knows more
about this place than I do.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.769
Play nice.

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.355
-Hello.
-Hello, Milo.

00:05:55.732 --> 00:05:57.149
My name's Lucian.

00:05:58.484 --> 00:06:01.195
The person who was here before was Milo.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:02.112
No.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.532
He was also the new Milo.

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.993
And before him was the other new Milo.

00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:10.329
I don't even remember the first Milo.

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:13.123
How long have you been here?

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.417
Long as I can remember.

00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:18.420
-And you're still not cured?
-There is no cure.

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:21.800
There's something missing from our DNA.

00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:24.176
Like a piece of a puzzle.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.053
And until they find it,

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:29.348
the only way to stay alive is
an oil change three times a day.

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:36.606
What would you do if you could be normal?

00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:38.608
Just for an hour?

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:43.530
I don't think about it.

00:06:43.613 --> 00:06:46.156
Hey, look at the freaks! Look at them!

00:06:51.954 --> 00:06:53.790
Best not to be outside
when school gets out.

00:06:54.707 --> 00:06:56.668
Like the original Spartans,

00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:59.504
we are the few against the many.

00:07:06.218 --> 00:07:07.428
Milo?

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:09.764
Milo?

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:11.850
Nurse?

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:22.652
Okay...

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.704
Lucian.

00:07:34.413 --> 00:07:35.414
Lucian!

00:07:42.714 --> 00:07:44.591
With one of these?

00:07:44.674 --> 00:07:47.050
It took a team of scientists
to build that machine

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:49.219
and you fixed it with a ballpoint pen?

00:07:54.767 --> 00:07:57.604
There's a school
for gifted children in New York.

00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:02.817
I think that I could get them
to agree to cover your tuition

00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:06.069
and provide private care
to help manage your condition.

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:10.407
Somewhere you could study,
learn, hone your skills.

00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:14.286
You have a gift, Michael.

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:18.708
I don't think I could forgive myself
if I saw it go to waste.

00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:21.628
"Dear Milo,

00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.295
this isn't goodbye.

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.088
I'm gonna find a cure for us,

00:08:25.715 --> 00:08:28.133
so we can be cranky old men someday.

00:08:28.217 --> 00:08:29.636
Your friend, Michael.

00:08:30.637 --> 00:08:32.471
P.S. You shouldn't have unfolded this.

00:08:32.555 --> 00:08:34.682
Now you'll never get it back together.

00:08:34.766 --> 00:08:35.892
See you this summer."

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.311
No.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.026
"Dear Milo..."

00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:49.822
-Please, can I have my letter back?
-What?

00:08:49.906 --> 00:08:51.866
Please, can I have my letter back?

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.450
Okay. Here.

00:08:55.578 --> 00:08:56.411
Please.

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.748
Please!

00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:01.000
Please!

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.129
Stop.

00:09:11.844 --> 00:09:12.845
Go away!

00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:19.727
Let me have a look. Let me have a look.

00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.146
He tried to steal my letter!

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.190
Milo, Milo, stop.

00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:26.943
Stop. Stop. Stop.

00:09:28.653 --> 00:09:29.988
What about Milo?

00:09:30.613 --> 00:09:32.031
I'll look after Milo.

00:09:32.657 --> 00:09:33.950
He needs me.

00:09:35.868 --> 00:09:39.706
Michael Morbius completed
his doctorate by 19

00:09:39.789 --> 00:09:41.916
and quickly established himself

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.004
as the world's leading authority
on blood-borne diseases.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.422
His development of artificial blood

00:09:48.506 --> 00:09:51.968
has saved more lives than penicillin.

00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:53.468
Michael Morbius,

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.722
please step forward

00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:58.600
to acknowledge the receipt of your prize

00:09:58.683 --> 00:10:01.769
from His Majesty the King of Sweden.

00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:19.621
I can't believe you dissed
the King of Sweden.

00:10:19.704 --> 00:10:22.749
The King and the Queen,
their loyal subjects, all of Scandinavia,

00:10:22.832 --> 00:10:26.002
and the entire scientific community.

00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:28.170
Yeah, but who does that?

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:31.841
Well, Anna, we both know I have issues.

00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:34.594
But, hey, I kept the program.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:42.518
There you are.

00:10:42.602 --> 00:10:44.729
-Hey, Dr. Bancroft.
-Hey, Anna.

00:10:44.812 --> 00:10:47.523
-We going to play?
-Oh, I don't think so.

00:10:47.607 --> 00:10:52.486
See, now that Dr. Morbius is back,
maybe you should try losing for a while,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.531
-see how that feels.
-Not gonna happen.

00:10:55.615 --> 00:10:57.950
-Michael.
-Yes?

00:10:58.034 --> 00:10:59.242
You got a minute?

00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:00.410
Of course.

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:03.163
New one. For your collection.

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:07.794
Dr. Morbius is in trouble.

00:11:07.877 --> 00:11:09.252
I'm in trouble.

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:15.510
"I can't accept a prize
for the byproduct of a failed experiment."

00:11:15.593 --> 00:11:16.594
Lab 1.

00:11:16.678 --> 00:11:21.516
Front page,
"American Scientist Rejects Nobel Prize."

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:25.978
You know that people actually like
writing checks to Nobel laureates?

00:11:26.604 --> 00:11:28.773
Makes them feel better
about their investment.

00:11:29.732 --> 00:11:32.819
It would help if you stuck around
long enough to cash them.

00:11:34.112 --> 00:11:36.072
You're pushing yourself too hard.

00:11:40.576 --> 00:11:44.080
Does our generous benefactor, Milo,
know what you're actually doing here?

00:11:44.872 --> 00:11:46.749
What am I actually doing here?

00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:49.418
Remixing human DNA with bat DNA.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.547
-I have no idea what you're--
-Talking about?

00:11:53.923 --> 00:11:55.091
Is anything ringing a bell?

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.052
No bells ringing.

00:11:58.136 --> 00:12:00.930
Okay. Maybe this will jog your memory.

00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:02.724
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

00:12:10.648 --> 00:12:11.649
That is a...

00:12:12.525 --> 00:12:15.069
It's a fish tank. Like, for...

00:12:15.695 --> 00:12:16.738
flying mammals.

00:12:18.614 --> 00:12:19.741
I see.

00:12:19.824 --> 00:12:22.409
Some friends I brought back
from Costa Rica.

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:23.995
So when were you gonna tell me?

00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:28.916
More importantly,
how did you get my pass code?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.461
It's the first six digits of pi backwards.
It's your password for everything.

00:12:32.545 --> 00:12:33.921
You should change that.

00:12:34.005 --> 00:12:36.090
You could lose your license for this.

00:12:36.174 --> 00:12:39.135
I'm not gonna need it much longer, doctor.

00:12:40.052 --> 00:12:43.514
You, on the other hand, will.

00:12:46.017 --> 00:12:48.770
You know, there's something
called "plausible deniability."

00:12:48.853 --> 00:12:50.312
You should be thanking me.

00:12:56.235 --> 00:12:58.738
These are the only mammals on Earth

00:12:58.821 --> 00:13:02.742
that have evolved
to feed exclusively on blood.

00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:04.786
So in order to drink it,

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:09.999
these bats produce saliva
that contains unique anticoagulants.

00:13:10.082 --> 00:13:14.336
So your theory is, if you can successfully
splice vampire genes into your DNA,

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:17.632
it would allow your body
to produce those same anticoagulants.

00:13:17.715 --> 00:13:18.716
Yes.

00:13:20.134 --> 00:13:21.426
It would be a cure.

00:13:22.261 --> 00:13:23.638
At what cost?

00:13:23.721 --> 00:13:29.185
The fusion of different species is
a legacy we already carry in our bodies.

00:13:29.268 --> 00:13:32.772
Viruses insinuating
their nucleic acid onto our own

00:13:32.855 --> 00:13:35.440
over hundreds of thousands of years.

00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:37.276
That's evolution. This is different.

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:38.485
I don't think it is.

00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:42.447
We have to push the boundaries,
take the risks.

00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:44.700
Without that,

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:46.994
there is no science.

00:13:48.204 --> 00:13:49.205
No medicine.

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:51.541
No breakthroughs at all.

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:14.230
Test subject for cell combination 117.

00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:37.837
Come on, come on, come on.

00:14:55.897 --> 00:14:58.900
Test subject 117 has resulted in...

00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:01.235
failure.

00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:09.076
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

00:15:11.203 --> 00:15:14.081
I should've died years ago, Martine.

00:15:16.042 --> 00:15:18.336
Why am I still alive if not to fix this?

00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:20.713
To save my best friend, Milo.

00:15:21.547 --> 00:15:23.507
And everyone else like us.

00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:24.926
Not like this.

00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:27.511
Dr. Morbius, it's Anna.

00:15:39.523 --> 00:15:41.901
Her temperature's spiking,
and her kidneys are shutting down.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:46.572
We have to induce a coma
before she has a stroke.

00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:49.283
-A hundred milligrams of propofol.
-Sure.

00:15:49.367 --> 00:15:50.368
Now.

00:15:51.661 --> 00:15:52.662
Come on.

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:55.706
It's okay.

00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:59.085
It's okay. We got you.

00:16:00.503 --> 00:16:01.504
There you go.

00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:04.340
There you go.

00:16:06.217 --> 00:16:07.426
Thank you, nurse.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.595
We're gonna let you sleep a bit.

00:16:11.806 --> 00:16:14.850
Take a nice long nap.

00:16:24.527 --> 00:16:25.987
-Michael.
-What?

00:16:28.531 --> 00:16:29.907
It worked.

00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:51.637
Dr. Michael Morbius.

00:16:52.847 --> 00:16:55.683
Some crippled guy's here to see the Boss.

00:16:55.766 --> 00:16:57.560
Michael! Get over here!

00:16:58.394 --> 00:17:01.564
As long as I am a cripple you'll be fine.

00:17:04.442 --> 00:17:05.651
You're late.

00:17:05.735 --> 00:17:08.404
I was trying out
this new thing called "working."

00:17:08.487 --> 00:17:11.282
Oh, yeah. I don't believe
I'm familiar with the word.

00:17:11.365 --> 00:17:13.117
I don't believe you are.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.244
So, what's up with the goon squad?

00:17:15.327 --> 00:17:17.830
Oh, I won a hand of cards
against some Russian gentlemen.

00:17:17.913 --> 00:17:19.915
Apparently they found his luck improbable.

00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:21.000
There you are.

00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:22.460
More like impossible.

00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:24.754
So, doctor, how is our favorite patient?

00:17:24.837 --> 00:17:27.507
Still determined
to make his short life even shorter?

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.216
Yes, I am.
Anyway, you're one to talk.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.135
You look terrible.
Look at the state of you.

00:17:31.218 --> 00:17:34.263
Says the man wearing--
What is that, a quilt?

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:37.099
Oh, sorry. I didn't get the memo
to dress for a funeral.

00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:42.980
Right. I will see you later.

00:17:43.064 --> 00:17:44.607
And you...

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:45.941
my door is always open.

00:17:47.443 --> 00:17:49.278
We miss you at Horizon.

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:50.821
We could use your mind.

00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:53.699
-I'll leave you two to your fun.
-Bye, Nicholas.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.035
I have some good news.

00:17:56.786 --> 00:17:58.162
Let's go for a walk.

00:17:59.539 --> 00:18:01.373
How's Martine doing these days?

00:18:01.457 --> 00:18:06.837
Dr. Bancroft? She is overqualified,
outperforming, brilliant as usual.

00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:08.548
And a royal pain in my ass.

00:18:08.631 --> 00:18:10.883
But she's keeping me honest
for the most part. Why do you ask?

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:15.346
No reason.
Just haven't seen you in forever.

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:17.348
I wondered
if she had something to do with it.

00:18:18.307 --> 00:18:19.767
I miss you too.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.770
But, yes, she has been working
with me to save our lives.

00:18:22.853 --> 00:18:25.524
I could ask her to stop if you like,
put us out of our misery.

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:29.151
Just don't do something stupid
and go and fall in love

00:18:29.235 --> 00:18:32.863
because, believe you me,
there is absolutely no cure for that.

00:18:32.947 --> 00:18:35.449
Says the guy who knows
absolutely nothing about the subject.

00:18:35.534 --> 00:18:37.577
Not true.
I read about it in books all the time.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.328
-Books, really?
-Yeah.

00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:42.289
Or romantic comedies. The point is...

00:18:42.998 --> 00:18:46.586
The point is, love is not
on the cards for us, my friend.

00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:48.963
Listen, if you start quoting
The Notebook to me,

00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:53.092
I am going to stop and hobble
very slowly in the opposite direction.

00:18:53.676 --> 00:18:54.802
Throw it!

00:18:54.885 --> 00:18:56.095
I'm close, Milo.

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:58.430
I can feel it.

00:19:00.975 --> 00:19:01.976
A cure.

00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:05.146
It's finally possible.

00:19:06.939 --> 00:19:10.067
-Seriously?
-Highly experimental.

00:19:10.776 --> 00:19:13.362
Ethically questionable.

00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:18.409
-Very, very, very expensive.
-I knew that was coming.

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:20.703
And not exactly legal.

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:24.541
Oh, and it has to be done
in international waters.

00:19:26.167 --> 00:19:27.710
You were always expensive.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.880
Is it dangerous? Should I be worried?

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:34.925
-You want me to lie to you?
-That would be nice, yes.

00:19:35.009 --> 00:19:37.887
-It's a walk in the park on a sunny day.
-Oh, that bad?

00:19:40.181 --> 00:19:41.182
Listen.

00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:44.393
We don't have much time left.

00:19:47.606 --> 00:19:49.398
This could be our last chance.

00:19:53.903 --> 00:19:55.112
So, what do you say?

00:19:56.947 --> 00:19:58.365
We go out with a fight?

00:20:02.328 --> 00:20:03.329
Yeah.

00:20:06.957 --> 00:20:07.791
You with me?

00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:11.045
Till the day you die, brother.

00:20:11.128 --> 00:20:14.423
Till the day you die.
You'll have everything you need.

00:20:15.634 --> 00:20:17.801
We're the original Spartans, mate.

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:20.721
-The few against the many.
-Yeah.

00:20:30.231 --> 00:20:34.068
-You know, I'm sure you're cheating.
-No. No, you're not.

00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:35.736
What you got?

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:39.114
Putting another one in the oven.
Wish me luck.

00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:48.332
The moment of truth.

00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:08.603
Success, Martine. We did it.

00:21:08.687 --> 00:21:10.145
It's holding together.

00:21:11.397 --> 00:21:13.692
Test 243.

00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:16.569
Human trials.

00:21:33.252 --> 00:21:34.461
I'm glad it's you.

00:21:40.843 --> 00:21:43.555
-Had a lot of other suitors, didn't you?
-Yeah.

00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:48.809
You know, the whole near-death thing
is very, very chic.

00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:51.895
I read it in Cosmo.

00:21:54.231 --> 00:21:56.191
Do they still make Cosmo? I don't know.

00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:09.748
I know it's just what you always wanted.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.667
Could be a collector's item one day,
you never know.

00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:14.918
This better not be my last one.

00:22:16.128 --> 00:22:18.339
I know this is painful, but you got it.

00:22:21.842 --> 00:22:24.386
-That's it. Bingo.
-Right there.

00:22:29.433 --> 00:22:30.602
Almost there, almost there.

00:22:35.815 --> 00:22:38.400
It's all right. Come on. Come on.

00:22:39.318 --> 00:22:40.319
There you go.

00:22:50.204 --> 00:22:52.039
You can buckle me up.

00:22:52.122 --> 00:22:53.123
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:56.335
You all right? Great.

00:23:23.362 --> 00:23:24.363
I call.

00:23:26.156 --> 00:23:28.909
-Bringing out the big guns.
-Let's go again.

00:23:28.992 --> 00:23:30.911
I'll be back.
I'm gonna check on the doctor.

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:31.995
All right.

00:23:48.805 --> 00:23:52.474
-You shouldn't be down here.
-I can be wherever I want, nurse.

00:23:53.685 --> 00:23:55.310
It's "doctor," actually.

00:23:57.104 --> 00:24:02.276
-I'm afraid you're gonna have to leave.
-Doctor. Sure, I can see it.

00:24:03.026 --> 00:24:06.531
But you're still the help, just like me.

00:24:08.616 --> 00:24:11.160
You can tell all that
by just looking at me, huh?

00:24:11.243 --> 00:24:14.581
And here I thought you were
just another jacked-up dumbshit.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.291
Get out.

00:24:23.756 --> 00:24:24.883
Michael?

00:24:39.396 --> 00:24:40.857
-Michael?
-Where is he?

00:24:41.774 --> 00:24:42.609
Don't move.

00:24:44.234 --> 00:24:45.612
What the hell?

00:24:46.613 --> 00:24:48.656
Everybody down to the lab now.

00:24:49.323 --> 00:24:50.324
Roger that.

00:24:53.745 --> 00:24:55.204
Don't shoot!

00:25:04.338 --> 00:25:05.507
Michael!

00:25:07.926 --> 00:25:08.927
Stop!

00:25:15.808 --> 00:25:16.809
Michael.

00:25:21.063 --> 00:25:21.898
It's just me.

00:25:22.857 --> 00:25:23.858
It's just me.

00:25:25.442 --> 00:25:26.443
Michael, please.

00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:31.991
Michael, stop! Stop!

00:25:34.786 --> 00:25:37.329
-You're hurting yourself! Stop!
-Hey!

00:25:37.914 --> 00:25:39.289
Step back! Move!

00:25:39.958 --> 00:25:42.544
-Stop. Put that gun down--
-Move!

00:26:03.355 --> 00:26:06.609
-Shit. Close it! Close it!
-What the hell is that thing?

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.670
-Fall back! Fall back!
-Shit.

00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:35.262
-Let's move.
-Go, go, go!

00:26:38.975 --> 00:26:40.100
Johnny!

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.608
Get out of here!

00:26:50.862 --> 00:26:52.321
Sweeping Level 3.

00:26:53.405 --> 00:26:55.033
Jason, come in.

00:26:55.115 --> 00:26:56.909
Jason. Jason?

00:27:02.164 --> 00:27:02.999
Oh, shit.

00:27:04.917 --> 00:27:06.126
Son of a bitch!

00:27:14.969 --> 00:27:15.803
Shit!

00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:18.138
Shit!

00:29:02.785 --> 00:29:03.870
Martine.

00:29:05.163 --> 00:29:06.164
Martine.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.304
Oh, my God.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.630
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is the LCV Murnau.

00:29:55.713 --> 00:29:58.423
Call letters 3-X5Y.

00:29:58.508 --> 00:30:01.677
We are 13 nautical miles
off the coast of Long Island.

00:30:01.761 --> 00:30:04.514
Request immediate airlift.

00:30:04.597 --> 00:30:08.267
Repeat, this is the LCV Murnau.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.103
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

00:30:27.578 --> 00:30:29.038
It's up here to the right.

00:30:30.372 --> 00:30:32.250
FBI Agent Stroud.

00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:35.002
Can we have the room, please?

00:30:35.086 --> 00:30:37.171
You heard the man.
Can we please have the room?

00:30:37.255 --> 00:30:39.632
If you could start exiting,
that'd be fantastic.

00:30:46.138 --> 00:30:49.308
We haven't had anything this good
since that thing in San Francisco.

00:30:49.391 --> 00:30:51.686
Eight bodies, running IDs right now,

00:30:51.769 --> 00:30:55.189
but apparently they all shop
at the same mercenary supply store.

00:30:56.148 --> 00:30:59.026
One survivor, a Dr. Martine Bancroft.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.319
Can we talk to her?

00:31:00.402 --> 00:31:03.906
If she wakes up. She fell down
and hit her head, apparently.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.617
-Anything else?
-Someone made a mayday call.

00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:08.493
-Not Dr. Bancroft.
-Nope.

00:31:08.578 --> 00:31:12.623
It was a male, didn't identify himself,
then wiped all the surveillance footage.

00:31:12.707 --> 00:31:14.542
Then he grew a conscience
and jumped overboard?

00:31:14.625 --> 00:31:16.335
It happens. Oh, and get this.

00:31:16.418 --> 00:31:20.673
All the bodies that you're looking at
are nearly drained of their blood.

00:31:22.008 --> 00:31:24.802
So, what hunts at night
and drinks human blood?

00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:29.265
You're gonna love this.

00:31:29.807 --> 00:31:32.351
Early this morning
an unmanned cargo ship was discovered

00:31:32.434 --> 00:31:36.022
near the eastern tip of Long Island
with multiple bodies onboard.

00:31:36.105 --> 00:31:39.275
Authorities are not making
any comment at this time.

00:31:39.358 --> 00:31:41.193
But there are reports of one survivor,

00:31:41.277 --> 00:31:43.863
and we have learned
from a high-ranking Coast Guard official

00:31:43.946 --> 00:31:46.574
that the vessel was flying
a Panamanian flag

00:31:46.657 --> 00:31:48.743
when it drifted in from international--

00:31:51.453 --> 00:31:52.454
What's happened?

00:31:54.414 --> 00:31:55.750
Some kind of accident.

00:31:59.003 --> 00:32:02.173
How's your pain today? On a one to ten?

00:32:03.257 --> 00:32:04.258
Eleven.

00:32:40.628 --> 00:32:41.629
I'm sorry.

00:32:43.673 --> 00:32:45.132
You're going to be okay.

00:32:58.312 --> 00:32:59.313
Lab 1.

00:33:00.147 --> 00:33:01.315
Privacy screens.

00:33:19.375 --> 00:33:21.335
Come on. Come on.

00:34:18.184 --> 00:34:19.852
As a result of my procedure,

00:34:19.935 --> 00:34:22.522
I have an overpowering urge
to consume...

00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:26.150
blood.

00:34:26.817 --> 00:34:28.027
Human blood.

00:34:32.281 --> 00:34:33.908
In certain respects,

00:34:33.991 --> 00:34:36.827
I have succeeded far beyond
anything I could have imagined.

00:34:37.661 --> 00:34:40.873
For the first time
in my entire life, I feel...

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:42.333
good.

00:34:43.502 --> 00:34:45.002
Yesterday, I could barely walk.

00:34:45.086 --> 00:34:48.255
Today, I don't know what I'm capable of.

00:35:01.018 --> 00:35:03.354
For a period of time after ingestion,

00:35:03.437 --> 00:35:04.772
my numbers are off the charts.

00:35:04.855 --> 00:35:08.359
I have the constitution
of an Olympic athlete.

00:35:09.151 --> 00:35:12.446
Increased strength and speed
that can only be described as...

00:35:13.155 --> 00:35:14.574
superhuman.

00:35:14.657 --> 00:35:16.200
And all of this...

00:35:16.992 --> 00:35:18.452
on artificial blood.

00:35:28.629 --> 00:35:31.508
I've become something different.

00:35:32.341 --> 00:35:34.093
I feel a kinship with these creatures.

00:35:34.176 --> 00:35:38.515
They would tear anyone else apart,
but they welcome me.

00:35:39.849 --> 00:35:40.933
Like a brother.

00:35:57.741 --> 00:36:00.911
I've even developed
a form of echolocation.

00:36:01.787 --> 00:36:03.956
Bat radar, for the uninitiated.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.751
The question is:

00:36:09.044 --> 00:36:10.379
How do I control it?

00:36:11.088 --> 00:36:12.173
Isolate it?

00:36:15.594 --> 00:36:16.595
Breathe.

00:36:19.598 --> 00:36:20.764
And let it go.

00:36:51.295 --> 00:36:54.633
But, unfortunately,
this condition is temporary.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.679
I've been timing myself.

00:37:00.346 --> 00:37:04.433
Artificial blood keeps me stable
for six hours.

00:37:05.392 --> 00:37:06.561
But that window...

00:37:07.562 --> 00:37:08.812
is growing shorter.

00:37:09.772 --> 00:37:11.482
Artificial blood won't work forever.

00:37:14.235 --> 00:37:15.945
One question remains:

00:37:17.112 --> 00:37:18.113
What if...?

00:37:18.822 --> 00:37:21.825
What if artificial blood
becomes ineffective?

00:37:23.703 --> 00:37:25.829
What happens if I go without?

00:37:25.913 --> 00:37:27.081
No blue...

00:37:27.748 --> 00:37:28.749
No red...

00:37:29.542 --> 00:37:30.376
Nothing.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.882
Eventually, my vitals drop precipitously

00:37:36.966 --> 00:37:38.801
and my illness returns with a vengeance.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.722
Soon, I'll face a choice.

00:37:44.516 --> 00:37:45.517
Drink the red...

00:37:46.308 --> 00:37:47.309
or die.

00:37:48.102 --> 00:37:49.729
But what happened on that ship...

00:37:50.522 --> 00:37:52.064
can't ever happen again.

00:38:21.343 --> 00:38:22.177
Michael.

00:38:23.596 --> 00:38:24.597
It's me.

00:38:25.264 --> 00:38:26.265
You in here?

00:38:29.101 --> 00:38:30.102
Where are you?

00:38:35.357 --> 00:38:36.191
Michael?

00:38:36.859 --> 00:38:39.153
Michael? What are you doing?

00:38:40.904 --> 00:38:43.449
Michael, it's Milo. What are you doing?

00:38:44.992 --> 00:38:46.118
Do you need help?

00:38:47.494 --> 00:38:48.495
What?

00:38:56.003 --> 00:38:57.254
"Blood."

00:38:58.964 --> 00:39:01.842
You want the blood in the freezer? Wait.

00:39:05.095 --> 00:39:07.389
I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm coming.

00:39:16.315 --> 00:39:18.233
Michael, hang on.

00:39:18.901 --> 00:39:20.903
Here. Here.

00:39:30.789 --> 00:39:31.790
Michael...

00:39:44.636 --> 00:39:45.637
You're strong.

00:39:46.345 --> 00:39:47.429
Michael.

00:39:48.305 --> 00:39:49.306
You did it.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.184
You did it. You found a cure to live.

00:39:52.893 --> 00:39:54.019
Michael.

00:39:55.563 --> 00:39:57.398
What? What is it?

00:39:57.481 --> 00:39:59.734
I've made a terrible mistake, Milo.

00:39:59.818 --> 00:40:01.820
We all make mistakes.
Don't worry about it.

00:40:01.902 --> 00:40:04.864
-You've never made one like this before.
-Michael, enough.

00:40:04.947 --> 00:40:08.992
Just give it to me. I need it.
I can't live like this any longer. Please.

00:40:09.076 --> 00:40:11.120
-I can't.
-What do you mean, you can't?

00:40:12.872 --> 00:40:15.040
-I can't.
-I need this.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.418
I've done things, Milo.

00:40:21.922 --> 00:40:23.508
I killed people.

00:40:24.383 --> 00:40:26.636
We can make that go away.

00:40:26.719 --> 00:40:29.848
The ones on the boat,
they're thugs, guns for hire.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:31.140
I can make that go away.

00:40:31.223 --> 00:40:33.350
-You don't understand.
-I do understand. Please.

00:40:33.434 --> 00:40:36.855
Have I ever denied you anything?
Said no? Have I always given you--?

00:40:36.937 --> 00:40:38.606
I can't control it!

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.569
What, so you get to live
and I get to die? Is that it?

00:40:48.198 --> 00:40:49.283
It's a curse.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.995
Believe me, brother. It is.

00:40:53.705 --> 00:40:56.666
Now, please, I need you to go.

00:40:56.749 --> 00:40:58.000
-It's not safe here.
-No.

00:40:58.793 --> 00:41:01.754
No, don't make me go.
Please, Michael, don't--

00:41:01.838 --> 00:41:03.046
I said, get out!

00:41:09.929 --> 00:41:11.681
I said, get out!

00:41:24.026 --> 00:41:25.027
Milo.

00:41:30.909 --> 00:41:32.075
She's right here.

00:41:35.914 --> 00:41:39.667
Dr. Bancroft?
Agents Stroud and Rodriguez.

00:41:40.877 --> 00:41:42.127
How you feeling, doctor?

00:41:42.795 --> 00:41:46.591
Like I'm in a hospital,
eating really crappy Jell-O.

00:41:46.674 --> 00:41:47.967
This shouldn't take long.

00:41:49.051 --> 00:41:52.722
You were out on a container ship
that washed up off of Long Island.

00:41:53.472 --> 00:41:55.892
Doctor, there were
eight dead bodies inside.

00:41:55.975 --> 00:41:59.979
We also noticed that their blood was...
What do you call it?

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:02.899
Exsanguinated. I looked it up.

00:42:03.983 --> 00:42:08.738
So sorry for the graphic nature
of some of these photos.

00:42:08.821 --> 00:42:13.242
But you're a doctor, so you know
what people look like on the inside.

00:42:13.325 --> 00:42:15.828
These puncture wounds right there,

00:42:16.453 --> 00:42:18.121
those look like fang marks to you?

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.926
Well, you were out there
conducting a major experiment.

00:42:30.677 --> 00:42:32.762
We're just hoping
you could shed some light.

00:42:33.972 --> 00:42:37.057
Yeah, that--
Not exactly sanitary, isn't it?

00:42:38.685 --> 00:42:41.854
I'm having a little bit of a hard time
remembering what happened that night.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.148
Sure. Let's go.

00:42:49.444 --> 00:42:52.322
You also work at the Horizon Lab, right?

00:42:53.198 --> 00:42:54.909
With Dr. Michael Morbius.

00:42:55.785 --> 00:42:56.786
Yes.

00:42:59.831 --> 00:43:01.331
Appreciate your time, doctor.

00:43:39.202 --> 00:43:40.245
Hello?

00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:52.634
Who's there?

00:43:57.972 --> 00:43:58.806
Hello?

00:45:08.751 --> 00:45:09.836
Get away from her.

00:45:10.628 --> 00:45:11.629
Just step back.

00:45:12.547 --> 00:45:13.881
Has she been there all night?

00:45:13.965 --> 00:45:16.092
Looks like all the blood
was drained from her body.

00:45:29.522 --> 00:45:32.315
-Any contusions?
-Not that I can see.

00:45:38.072 --> 00:45:39.657
Back to our rooms, okay?

00:46:10.437 --> 00:46:11.689
Dr. Morbius?

00:46:13.024 --> 00:46:14.316
Agent Stroud.

00:46:14.399 --> 00:46:16.401
Agent Rodriguez. Can we have a minute?

00:46:17.737 --> 00:46:19.321
Of course. How can I help you?

00:46:19.404 --> 00:46:21.199
First, I wanna say thank you.

00:46:21.281 --> 00:46:25.787
Your artificial blood actually saved
my arm in Afghanistan, sir.

00:46:26.746 --> 00:46:28.330
I'm glad I could be of service.

00:46:28.413 --> 00:46:33.127
I must admit, doc, you don't look
anything like you do on the news.

00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:35.171
Yeah, you look downright robust.

00:46:35.254 --> 00:46:36.881
I have good days and bad.

00:46:37.965 --> 00:46:39.299
Pilates helps.

00:46:40.009 --> 00:46:41.636
How are you on boats?

00:46:43.054 --> 00:46:44.304
As you can see...

00:46:45.305 --> 00:46:47.099
don't have very good sea legs.

00:46:49.101 --> 00:46:50.102
Why do you ask?

00:46:50.186 --> 00:46:53.898
'Cause you've been looking for a cure
for your condition your whole life, right?

00:46:54.899 --> 00:46:57.026
You've pretty much tried everything.

00:46:58.236 --> 00:47:00.947
Crazy experiments, maybe on a boat?

00:47:01.781 --> 00:47:04.742
"Crazy" isn't a term that I would use...

00:47:05.868 --> 00:47:06.702
detective.

00:47:07.369 --> 00:47:08.704
Unorthodox, maybe.

00:47:09.747 --> 00:47:12.041
But I'd do just about anything
to save a life.

00:47:12.834 --> 00:47:14.502
I'm sure you can understand that.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.880
Anything else I can help you two with?

00:47:20.758 --> 00:47:22.969
All units, the 120 block, Horizon Labs,

00:47:23.052 --> 00:47:26.055
female body drained of blood,
initiate lockdown.

00:47:26.138 --> 00:47:29.892
Copy that. Doc, got
a couple more questions for you.

00:47:30.893 --> 00:47:32.270
Yeah, you're coming with us.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.944
Hey, freeze!

00:47:40.027 --> 00:47:41.070
Stop him!

00:47:44.323 --> 00:47:45.157
Hey!

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:55.458
Hold fire!

00:47:56.418 --> 00:47:58.588
Get backup and meet me up top.

00:48:21.652 --> 00:48:22.653
Enough.

00:48:28.951 --> 00:48:30.536
It's worse than I first thought.

00:48:31.494 --> 00:48:35.499
At this rate, artificial blood will
stop working in a matter of days.

00:48:37.209 --> 00:48:39.253
8:13 p.m.

00:48:41.463 --> 00:48:46.594
Down from six hours
to four hours, 22 minutes.

00:48:50.181 --> 00:48:51.473
I got a problem.

00:49:12.411 --> 00:49:13.412
Holy water?

00:49:15.122 --> 00:49:16.582
-Really?
-What?

00:49:17.583 --> 00:49:19.210
I'm not taking any chances.

00:49:20.086 --> 00:49:21.629
It's triple blessed.

00:49:26.092 --> 00:49:29.053
We found this little guy
on the container ship...

00:49:30.638 --> 00:49:31.931
with those bodies.

00:49:34.016 --> 00:49:35.643
That's a little hobby of yours, right?

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:45.945
You know, eight dead mercs on a boat
really doesn't ruffle our feathers.

00:49:46.028 --> 00:49:48.364
I'm pretty sure
they were guilty of something

00:49:48.447 --> 00:49:51.075
-and happy to have them off the water.
-But Nurse Sutton,

00:49:51.158 --> 00:49:55.121
single mother with twin girls, that's...

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.666
-something else.
-Yes, I know.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:00.751
Her name was Kristen.

00:50:00.835 --> 00:50:03.421
We worked together
every single day for seven years.

00:50:04.922 --> 00:50:06.257
She was a good person.

00:50:06.924 --> 00:50:08.092
So why'd you do it?

00:50:13.264 --> 00:50:14.473
I can't answer that.

00:50:22.481 --> 00:50:24.608
What did you do to yourself, doctor?

00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:27.987
-Make us understand.
-I wish I knew.

00:50:33.075 --> 00:50:34.076
Okay.

00:50:34.827 --> 00:50:37.621
Great stuff. Really informative.

00:50:37.705 --> 00:50:38.706
Thank you.

00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:42.668
I dropped a bag.
There's something inside that I need.

00:50:42.752 --> 00:50:44.920
-Bag of artificial blood.
-Yeah.

00:50:45.004 --> 00:50:47.339
Yeah. It's in evidence, I'm sorry.

00:50:52.887 --> 00:50:54.263
I'm sorry.

00:50:55.931 --> 00:50:57.683
I'm starting to get hungry.

00:50:58.934 --> 00:51:01.103
And you don't wanna see me
when I'm hungry.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:08.235
We're done here. Let's go.

00:51:12.114 --> 00:51:13.115
Guard!

00:51:15.826 --> 00:51:16.952
Your lawyer's here.

00:51:30.509 --> 00:51:31.592
You look terrible.

00:51:34.929 --> 00:51:36.138
Lawyer, huh?

00:51:37.014 --> 00:51:39.183
I don't remember
you ever finishing law school.

00:51:39.266 --> 00:51:40.267
'Cause I didn't.

00:51:43.563 --> 00:51:44.772
Sit down. Sit down.

00:51:49.693 --> 00:51:53.906
I mean, if one of us was going
to end up in bright orange trainers,

00:51:53.989 --> 00:51:55.866
I would never have guessed
it would be you.

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:01.330
They're charging me with murder.

00:52:03.624 --> 00:52:06.001
I don't know. I don't know.

00:52:09.255 --> 00:52:10.756
Maybe I blacked out?

00:52:12.675 --> 00:52:13.676
Hey.

00:52:14.635 --> 00:52:15.928
Now listen to me.

00:52:18.389 --> 00:52:19.558
I don't believe it.

00:52:20.266 --> 00:52:21.642
You're not capable of that.

00:52:22.643 --> 00:52:26.397
I know that all you've ever
tried to do is help people.

00:52:27.607 --> 00:52:28.608
You don't belong here.

00:52:28.691 --> 00:52:32.111
This place is for terrorists
and drugs lords and God knows who.

00:52:32.194 --> 00:52:34.989
Michael, we need to get you out of here.

00:52:35.739 --> 00:52:37.241
In whatever way possible.

00:52:37.324 --> 00:52:39.160
Maybe this is where I belong.

00:52:40.035 --> 00:52:42.371
If I'm in here, then nobody else dies.

00:52:42.454 --> 00:52:43.289
Listen to me.

00:52:44.039 --> 00:52:46.250
You are not capable of killing that woman.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.045
Hey, Your Highness, time's up.

00:52:51.506 --> 00:52:53.550
Michael, here's something
to keep you going.

00:52:55.926 --> 00:52:56.927
Guard.

00:53:24.872 --> 00:53:25.915
Never too early.

00:53:41.722 --> 00:53:42.723
Milo.

00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:02.159
Milo!

00:54:30.563 --> 00:54:32.022
Let's move! Let's move!

00:54:32.106 --> 00:54:33.482
Come on, this way!

00:54:43.033 --> 00:54:44.285
Let's go. Let's go.

00:54:44.827 --> 00:54:45.995
Open the door.

00:54:46.078 --> 00:54:47.079
Now! Go!

00:54:48.289 --> 00:54:49.373
He's getting away!

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.774
Daily Bugle, please, sir.

00:55:14.857 --> 00:55:17.067
-There you go, buddy.
-Here you are, my friend.

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:23.490
-Always figured that guy for a freak.
-How's that? You've never met him.

00:55:23.575 --> 00:55:26.661
I mean, look at him.
What else you need to know?

00:55:26.745 --> 00:55:29.539
You know, you shouldn't judge someone
by how they look.

00:55:29.622 --> 00:55:31.499
Didn't your mother teach you any manners?

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.460
Take me, for example.

00:55:34.544 --> 00:55:36.796
I may look harmless enough.

00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:38.757
Do you think I'm joking?

00:55:58.233 --> 00:55:59.068
Milo!

00:56:01.236 --> 00:56:02.237
Got me.

00:56:02.321 --> 00:56:04.990
You see? I knew you could do it.

00:56:05.074 --> 00:56:07.577
You took the serum
even after I warned you.

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.538
What am I gonna do, lay down and die?
Thank you for the death wish.

00:56:10.622 --> 00:56:12.122
I tried to protect you!

00:56:12.206 --> 00:56:13.999
Protect me? Protect me from what?

00:56:14.083 --> 00:56:15.627
Becoming a monster like me.

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:18.295
I don't think you're a monster. Okay?

00:56:18.379 --> 00:56:19.839
I killed the nurse.

00:56:19.922 --> 00:56:21.508
I killed the nurse.

00:56:21.591 --> 00:56:24.761
I know. But you know
what it's like your first time.

00:56:24.844 --> 00:56:28.263
You have no idea what you're doing.
You have no control.

00:56:28.347 --> 00:56:29.181
No.

00:56:32.476 --> 00:56:34.144
Milo, you have to stop.

00:56:34.228 --> 00:56:37.314
You have to stop.
You have to stop denying who you are.

00:56:37.398 --> 00:56:40.652
It's boring. We can go anywhere,
we can do anything. Let's go.

00:56:40.735 --> 00:56:42.403
Let's have some fun.

00:56:42.486 --> 00:56:43.613
This isn't you.

00:56:45.824 --> 00:56:46.825
I know you.

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:51.120
-Where's the brother that I used to have?
-How can you say that to me?

00:56:52.329 --> 00:56:53.956
Look what you've become.

00:56:54.582 --> 00:56:58.127
Everything I am, I am because of you.
I looked up to you my whole life.

00:56:58.878 --> 00:57:02.423
I will never leave you,
and I will not go back.

00:57:02.507 --> 00:57:05.844
You cannot make me go back.
I won't let you make me go back!

00:57:21.734 --> 00:57:23.235
Move, bitch, move!

00:57:35.038 --> 00:57:36.039
Goodness.

00:57:38.543 --> 00:57:40.294
We've evolved!

00:57:41.754 --> 00:57:43.046
You're a scientist, Michael.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:46.008
Surely, surely you understand that.

00:57:46.091 --> 00:57:48.302
That's not what this is.
This is a mistake.

00:57:49.261 --> 00:57:52.264
But I can fix it.
I'll figure out how to reverse it.

00:57:52.347 --> 00:57:54.934
Artificial blood will keep us stable
until I do.

00:57:55.017 --> 00:57:58.020
Yeah, I'm fine just the way I am,
thank you very much.

00:57:58.103 --> 00:58:00.272
Hey! Hands up!

00:58:00.355 --> 00:58:02.525
-Up against the wall. Now.
-Officer.

00:58:02.609 --> 00:58:04.193
-Come on.
-Anything you say.

00:58:04.276 --> 00:58:06.069
-You. Don't move.
-Okey-dokey.

00:58:08.489 --> 00:58:10.073
We have the suspects.

00:58:10.742 --> 00:58:11.910
Like we used to say...

00:58:12.744 --> 00:58:13.953
live a little.

00:58:18.791 --> 00:58:20.960
-Hey!
-Freeze!

00:58:32.346 --> 00:58:35.975
All our lives, we've lived
with death hanging over us.

00:58:36.559 --> 00:58:37.560
Why?

00:58:38.435 --> 00:58:43.525
Why shouldn't they know
what it feels like for a change, Michael?

00:58:44.358 --> 00:58:46.819
Michael!

00:58:48.028 --> 00:58:49.781
Michael.

00:59:06.213 --> 00:59:08.173
I'm not gonna fight you, Milo.

01:00:22.957 --> 01:00:25.710
Now he's laying out officers
in my city, huh?

01:00:27.127 --> 01:00:28.253
It's unforgiveable.

01:00:32.466 --> 01:00:34.844
Just keep your eyes on Dr. Bancroft.

01:00:34.927 --> 01:00:35.928
Yeah.

01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:32.610
Woman in the jeans, where'd she go?

01:01:33.945 --> 01:01:35.071
Yeah, right.

01:01:41.786 --> 01:01:43.037
Great.

01:01:56.718 --> 01:01:57.552
Hey, stranger.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.681
Michael?

01:02:05.727 --> 01:02:06.936
You shouldn't be here.

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:11.356
I didn't kill Nurse Sutton or the police.

01:02:12.482 --> 01:02:13.985
Or any of those people.

01:02:15.862 --> 01:02:16.863
I know.

01:02:17.572 --> 01:02:18.698
Milo, he--

01:02:19.364 --> 01:02:21.117
He took the serum.

01:02:21.909 --> 01:02:23.077
He's out there.

01:02:23.953 --> 01:02:25.412
And I have to stop him.

01:02:28.415 --> 01:02:29.792
But I need your help.

01:02:36.298 --> 01:02:37.299
Coffee?

01:02:38.092 --> 01:02:40.343
-No, thanks. I quit caffeine.
-It's decaf.

01:02:51.438 --> 01:02:53.858
-Not that kind of vampire.
-Just checking.

01:02:54.942 --> 01:02:58.361
I shouldn't have
dragged you out there. I'm sorry.

01:02:58.445 --> 01:02:59.446
You didn't.

01:03:00.698 --> 01:03:02.033
I wanted to be there.

01:03:02.658 --> 01:03:04.118
Well, then apology rescinded.

01:03:04.869 --> 01:03:06.495
I guess we're both a little crazy.

01:03:06.579 --> 01:03:07.955
How do you feel?

01:03:08.039 --> 01:03:09.289
Incredible.

01:03:09.372 --> 01:03:12.752
I mean, I went from dying my entire life
to feeling more alive than ever.

01:03:13.836 --> 01:03:16.463
Thankfully,
artificial blood keeps me stable.

01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:18.216
I just have to drink it more often.

01:03:18.841 --> 01:03:19.675
How often?

01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:23.888
Every four hours, 22 minutes.
Down from six.

01:03:23.971 --> 01:03:25.765
It's losing its effectiveness.

01:03:26.348 --> 01:03:29.476
The issue is, when it stops working...

01:03:31.771 --> 01:03:33.438
I'll become like Milo.

01:03:35.024 --> 01:03:36.108
You won't.

01:03:38.528 --> 01:03:40.154
Hi. Over there.

01:03:46.744 --> 01:03:48.079
Sorry, this one's no good.

01:03:48.162 --> 01:03:50.623
Check it again. And keep one for yourself.

01:03:50.706 --> 01:03:52.625
No, I don't wanna do it.

01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:54.376
There's plenty more where those came from.

01:03:54.459 --> 01:03:56.587
Come on, man,
we gotta get back to the lab.

01:04:03.886 --> 01:04:04.887
Michael?

01:04:05.513 --> 01:04:06.722
Okay, I know that look.

01:04:06.806 --> 01:04:08.766
You're up to something. What is it?

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:11.686
I'll need a couple of things from the lab.
Can you do that for me?

01:04:11.769 --> 01:04:14.272
Yes, I can. But you didn't
answer my question. What is it?

01:04:14.354 --> 01:04:15.898
You're right. I'm up to something.

01:04:25.157 --> 01:04:26.784
-You got the blood?
-Got it.

01:04:59.525 --> 01:05:01.652
The ink on this new batch is pretty legit.

01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:03.821
It's a good thing
we switched the chemicals.

01:05:03.905 --> 01:05:05.197
Yo, finish up.

01:05:38.856 --> 01:05:40.983
It's a nice place that you got here.

01:05:41.859 --> 01:05:43.485
I love this movie.

01:05:43.569 --> 01:05:45.988
Is this the part where the mysterious guy
with the hoodie comes in

01:05:46.072 --> 01:05:48.658
and kicks everybody's asses?
I love that part.

01:05:48.741 --> 01:05:49.742
Who the hell are you?

01:05:49.825 --> 01:05:53.495
It doesn't matter,
but I am gonna need your laboratory.

01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:56.499
You can keep all the money,
all your little toys.

01:05:56.582 --> 01:06:01.253
Just leave the science-y stuff
and that bag of spicy Cheetos.

01:06:01.337 --> 01:06:03.714
-He wants my lab?
-Yeah.

01:06:05.299 --> 01:06:06.466
You trying to be funny?

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:09.469
No, no, no.
Absolutely not. That's their job.

01:06:09.553 --> 01:06:12.556
-I mean, look at their matching necklaces.
-Time to go.

01:06:15.267 --> 01:06:17.937
Did you know that there are 27 bones
in the human hand?

01:06:18.813 --> 01:06:20.606
Allow me to introduce the phalanges.

01:06:21.816 --> 01:06:22.817
The metacarpals.

01:06:23.442 --> 01:06:24.735
-Shit.
-Let's get the fuck out of here!

01:06:24.819 --> 01:06:27.196
And the pretty, little stinky pinkie.

01:06:30.574 --> 01:06:32.743
-Who the hell are you, man?
-Me?

01:06:33.369 --> 01:06:36.372
I am Venom.

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:39.750
You can go now.

01:06:43.462 --> 01:06:46.257
Six to eight weeks, a little ibuprofen.

01:06:47.341 --> 01:06:48.718
Should heal up just fine.

01:08:14.804 --> 01:08:16.889
Yo. Can I get a tequila, please?

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.974
Don Julio 1942.

01:08:29.693 --> 01:08:30.694
Do I know you?

01:08:31.445 --> 01:08:32.780
Me?

01:08:32.863 --> 01:08:35.116
-Yeah.
-No, I don't think so.

01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:37.409
We've met.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.078
I'm sure of it.

01:08:39.161 --> 01:08:40.287
No, I'd remember.

01:08:41.455 --> 01:08:42.541
You're too pretty.

01:08:43.624 --> 01:08:46.710
You know what they say,
"Tequila to remember, whiskey to forget."

01:08:48.588 --> 01:08:49.630
That's good.

01:08:49.713 --> 01:08:51.508
Sir, two tequilas, please.

01:08:54.511 --> 01:08:55.886
Hey, yo.

01:08:57.847 --> 01:08:59.431
Her drinks are spoken for, bro.

01:09:02.685 --> 01:09:03.686
You know what?

01:09:04.521 --> 01:09:08.232
I'm gonna do you a favor
and let you walk out of here, all right?

01:09:08.315 --> 01:09:11.944
That's very kind of you. Here was I
thinking you're a complete asshole.

01:09:12.027 --> 01:09:17.074
Sir, can I get my friend here
and his friends a round of whiskeys?

01:09:18.618 --> 01:09:19.827
Hey!

01:09:28.545 --> 01:09:29.712
I'll get you another drink.

01:09:30.921 --> 01:09:31.755
Hey.

01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:35.342
Another time.

01:09:38.846 --> 01:09:39.680
Jerk.

01:09:42.141 --> 01:09:44.894
Did you see the size of that guy?
I'm not paying for those drinks.

01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:19.386
Martine.

01:10:23.265 --> 01:10:24.433
Milo.

01:10:24.517 --> 01:10:27.562
Sorry. I let myself in.
I hope I didn't startle you.

01:10:28.647 --> 01:10:29.648
It's okay.

01:10:30.898 --> 01:10:32.816
If I'd known
our biggest funder was coming,

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.985
I would have planned a nice dinner for us.

01:10:37.738 --> 01:10:39.490
Actually, I've already eaten.

01:10:43.494 --> 01:10:45.913
Whatever it is,
it's doing wonders for your health.

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:50.334
I feel great.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:52.629
What can I do for you?

01:10:52.712 --> 01:10:54.964
Well, it's Michael. I'm worried about him.

01:10:55.965 --> 01:10:57.383
He's alone out there.

01:10:57.466 --> 01:10:59.636
And I think he needs me.

01:11:00.844 --> 01:11:03.806
I don't know. If I can get to him
before the police do, I can help him.

01:11:04.473 --> 01:11:06.601
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, would you?

01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:09.729
You two have always been so close.

01:11:11.105 --> 01:11:12.064
I'm sorry.

01:11:14.191 --> 01:11:15.192
I don't.

01:11:24.285 --> 01:11:26.912
Just to be sure,
I'm going to ask you one more time.

01:11:29.666 --> 01:11:32.167
You don't happen to know
where he is, do you, Martine?

01:11:32.876 --> 01:11:34.211
I wouldn't lie to you, Milo.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:38.841
I don't.

01:11:43.929 --> 01:11:46.307
Now, if you don't mind, I have work to do.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:47.224
Okay.

01:11:48.225 --> 01:11:51.061
Well, if you see him,
if you hear from him, tell him:

01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:53.732
"We are the few against the many."

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.736
We'll have to do
that dinner another time, Martine.

01:12:24.679 --> 01:12:25.680
Police!

01:12:35.105 --> 01:12:36.106
Clear!

01:12:38.025 --> 01:12:39.026
Clear!

01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:50.747
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:12:57.629 --> 01:13:01.423
Cat's gone.
And she's probably gone along with it.

01:13:04.927 --> 01:13:07.179
It's time to eat, you little monster.

01:13:10.725 --> 01:13:11.892
Shit.

01:13:19.567 --> 01:13:20.568
Michael?

01:13:22.654 --> 01:13:23.655
Hey.

01:13:26.156 --> 01:13:26.990
Michael.

01:13:27.575 --> 01:13:28.576
I'm sorry.

01:13:32.955 --> 01:13:35.207
-You may wanna close that up.
-Yep.

01:13:45.092 --> 01:13:46.218
How does it feel...

01:13:47.595 --> 01:13:48.721
when you're on red?

01:13:51.558 --> 01:13:53.685
Something wakes up
inside of me, something...

01:13:56.688 --> 01:13:57.689
primal.

01:14:00.859 --> 01:14:01.942
And it just...

01:14:05.697 --> 01:14:06.947
And it wants to hunt.

01:14:09.659 --> 01:14:10.910
And wants to kill.

01:14:17.584 --> 01:14:19.001
I'm sorry.

01:14:50.867 --> 01:14:51.868
Hi.

01:14:55.287 --> 01:14:56.455
Good as new.

01:14:57.122 --> 01:14:58.415
Nice work, doctor.

01:14:59.249 --> 01:15:00.417
Thank you, doctor.

01:15:02.921 --> 01:15:04.589
You know, for the record...

01:15:06.298 --> 01:15:09.176
I wasn't gonna go
full Dracula on you downstairs.

01:15:09.928 --> 01:15:11.053
For the record...

01:15:12.137 --> 01:15:14.306
I find him to be quite the romantic.

01:15:14.933 --> 01:15:15.934
Come here.

01:15:17.059 --> 01:15:18.393
Just close your eyes.

01:15:20.479 --> 01:15:21.480
Okay.

01:15:23.357 --> 01:15:24.358
Move closer.

01:15:51.553 --> 01:15:54.597
Did you know the average male body
has 12 pints of blood in him?

01:15:54.681 --> 01:15:56.808
I mean, how much do you think
the doctor can drink?

01:15:57.809 --> 01:15:58.851
I don't know.

01:15:58.935 --> 01:16:00.895
When's the last time you had 36 beers?

01:16:01.563 --> 01:16:03.272
When's the last time you had any beers?

01:16:07.944 --> 01:16:09.236
CCTV.

01:16:10.195 --> 01:16:11.948
I'll go grab the footage.

01:16:12.031 --> 01:16:14.074
I don't want you
to have to move or anything.

01:16:18.955 --> 01:16:20.122
All right, check this out.

01:16:27.755 --> 01:16:28.756
Wait, wait, wait.

01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:32.010
Zoom in. And hold right there.

01:16:35.095 --> 01:16:36.764
That's not the doctor.

01:16:36.848 --> 01:16:39.642
It's what these bloodsuckers do.
They multiply.

01:16:39.726 --> 01:16:43.688
Breaking news on the Lower East Side
where three people have been killed.

01:16:43.771 --> 01:16:46.983
Authorities have confirmed
the discovery of three new bodies

01:16:47.066 --> 01:16:49.736
outside a bar
popular with Wall Street traders.

01:16:49.819 --> 01:16:51.361
And like the victims before them,

01:16:51.445 --> 01:16:53.740
they were completely drained
of their blood,

01:16:53.823 --> 01:16:57.367
earning the killer
the moniker "Vampire Murderer."

01:16:57.451 --> 01:17:01.914
The prime suspect, renowned scientist
Dr. Michael Morbius, remains at large.

01:17:01.998 --> 01:17:03.373
What have you got yourself into?

01:17:03.457 --> 01:17:06.002
However, another source
inside the department

01:17:06.085 --> 01:17:09.212
has told us
that CCTV footage of the murders

01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:11.674
suggests the killer could be a copycat.

01:17:11.758 --> 01:17:15.177
Residents are being urged
to stay home after sundown

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:18.514
until the killer, or killers,
are brought to justice.

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:21.141
Milo?

01:17:26.856 --> 01:17:28.691
You've discovered my secret.

01:17:29.232 --> 01:17:30.610
I mean, look at me.

01:17:33.362 --> 01:17:34.739
I am reborn.

01:17:35.782 --> 01:17:37.867
I am the resurrection.

01:17:39.035 --> 01:17:41.079
My God, what have you done to yourself?

01:17:41.788 --> 01:17:42.789
What?

01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:45.290
Do you disapprove?

01:17:46.291 --> 01:17:48.586
What's the matter, Nicholas?
Is Daddy cross?

01:17:49.671 --> 01:17:51.463
All right. Settle down.

01:17:51.547 --> 01:17:54.466
Let's go and have a drink together.
Come celebrate with me, please.

01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:56.135
-No.
-Just one drink.

01:17:56.218 --> 01:17:59.013
Milo, you're scaring me. Please. Just--

01:17:59.097 --> 01:18:01.641
Just calm down.

01:18:11.274 --> 01:18:12.694
What's the matter?

01:18:12.777 --> 01:18:14.779
I can't sleep.

01:18:14.862 --> 01:18:17.280
I can help you with that.

01:18:18.157 --> 01:18:21.119
I've been more than a friend
to you all this time, Milo.

01:18:21.994 --> 01:18:24.246
And I'm going to stay here with you.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.627
But there will be
no more violence, understand?

01:18:31.838 --> 01:18:33.463
That doesn't do it for me.

01:18:35.758 --> 01:18:37.719
I should have known.
You always take his side.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.888
Tell me your side, then, Milo.

01:18:40.972 --> 01:18:43.599
Michael doesn't accept
what he is, Nicholas.

01:18:43.683 --> 01:18:45.184
I'm gonna make him accept it.

01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:49.522
-By ruining his good name?
-See? There! There you are!

01:18:49.605 --> 01:18:53.233
Perfect Michael,
selfless Michael, Michael the favorite!

01:18:53.316 --> 01:18:57.237
Don't be childish, Milo! If anyone has
a claim to being my favorite, it's you.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.532
-I've devoted my life to you.
-Liar.

01:19:03.119 --> 01:19:04.579
You pitied me before.

01:19:06.956 --> 01:19:09.500
You did. You pitied me before.
You're repulsed by me now.

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:11.586
I am repulsed...

01:19:13.004 --> 01:19:14.296
by what you've done,

01:19:15.089 --> 01:19:17.091
by what you've become.

01:19:20.678 --> 01:19:24.015
Whatever this thing is...

01:19:24.766 --> 01:19:26.559
you're not up to it.

01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:29.311
There's no shame in what we are.

01:19:33.232 --> 01:19:35.067
"We are the few...

01:19:37.153 --> 01:19:38.237
against the many."

01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:49.165
Tell Michael, you tell him
I'm going to kill as many as I want.

01:20:01.552 --> 01:20:05.097
"He's only destroyed
by a stake through the heart,

01:20:05.181 --> 01:20:07.767
made from the wood of the Holy Cross."

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:09.727
You don't believe this.

01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:14.899
No. But after the week that I've had,
anything is possible.

01:20:16.275 --> 01:20:17.109
What is that?

01:20:17.193 --> 01:20:21.030
This is an antibody.

01:20:21.739 --> 01:20:25.993
It inhibits ferritin,
induces a massive iron overload,

01:20:26.077 --> 01:20:27.912
instant hemochromatosis.

01:20:29.247 --> 01:20:32.583
Deadly to bats, fatal to humans.

01:20:33.918 --> 01:20:37.004
Okay. Who's the second one for?

01:20:40.967 --> 01:20:43.010
My window's closing. We both know that.

01:20:43.845 --> 01:20:46.097
By tomorrow
I'll be forced to consume human blood.

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.807
I can't do that. I won't do that.

01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:49.474
So this is your solution, huh?

01:20:50.768 --> 01:20:52.645
Injecting yourself with poison?

01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:54.730
I brought this into the world.

01:20:57.567 --> 01:20:59.277
It's up to me to take it out.

01:21:03.781 --> 01:21:07.702
I need you to go now.
It's not safe here. Okay?

01:21:22.675 --> 01:21:23.843
Nicholas, you okay?

01:21:25.303 --> 01:21:27.889
Michael, I need help.

01:21:30.182 --> 01:21:32.226
I went to see Milo.

01:21:33.019 --> 01:21:34.020
Nicholas?

01:21:35.437 --> 01:21:36.438
Nicholas!

01:22:00.588 --> 01:22:01.589
Nicholas.

01:22:05.009 --> 01:22:06.010
Nicholas?

01:22:09.305 --> 01:22:10.306
Michael.

01:22:10.389 --> 01:22:12.808
Come on,
we have to get you to a hospital.

01:22:15.728 --> 01:22:18.981
You have to stop him.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.210
Michael.

01:22:40.836 --> 01:22:42.171
Michael.

01:22:43.047 --> 01:22:44.215
Call out for him.

01:22:46.759 --> 01:22:48.636
-I want him to hear you.
-No.

01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:50.096
Yeah.

01:22:50.721 --> 01:22:52.181
I won't ask you again.

01:22:53.473 --> 01:22:56.185
Say, "Michael."

01:22:57.895 --> 01:22:58.896
Michael.

01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:02.191
Good girl.

01:23:04.235 --> 01:23:05.611
Michael.

01:23:08.656 --> 01:23:10.992
-Michael.
-Yeah.

01:23:16.998 --> 01:23:17.999
Michael.

01:23:21.711 --> 01:23:22.712
Milo.

01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:25.881
You're hurting me.

01:23:27.049 --> 01:23:28.092
It's okay.

01:24:08.466 --> 01:24:09.467
Martine?

01:24:11.469 --> 01:24:14.013
Let me take a look. Martine.

01:24:14.096 --> 01:24:15.723
-Let me look.
-It's bad.

01:24:17.892 --> 01:24:18.893
Michael.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.145
Make it mean something.

01:24:22.563 --> 01:24:23.814
I can help you.

01:24:30.112 --> 01:24:31.197
I'm sorry.

01:25:31.508 --> 01:25:32.592
Drank the red.

01:25:34.135 --> 01:25:35.386
Good for you.

01:25:37.012 --> 01:25:39.390
It's just you and me, Michael!

01:25:39.473 --> 01:25:42.643
Nothing, no one, to hold us back.

01:25:42.726 --> 01:25:44.228
I'm all you have left.

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:48.274
That's the spirit. Yeah.

01:27:32.253 --> 01:27:34.088
Come on, Michael!

01:27:34.964 --> 01:27:36.215
Come on!

01:27:36.924 --> 01:27:39.426
You can do better than this!

01:27:40.177 --> 01:27:41.680
It's not a curse.

01:27:42.346 --> 01:27:43.640
It's a gift.

01:27:43.723 --> 01:27:47.351
You started this,
you created this, you created us!

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:29.221
Michael.

01:30:29.848 --> 01:30:30.931
You can't kill me.

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.185
I mean, it's me.

01:30:37.438 --> 01:30:38.648
You can't kill me.

01:30:50.951 --> 01:30:52.286
You gave me my name.

01:30:54.329 --> 01:30:55.164
Remember?

01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:59.293
I remember everything.

01:31:02.337 --> 01:31:03.338
I'm sorry.

01:31:22.609 --> 01:31:23.610
Lucian.

01:32:03.023 --> 01:32:05.985
-Stay back, people.
-Get back! Back!

01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:28.127
Hope the food's better in this joint.

01:34:29.796 --> 01:34:33.256
A bizarre story developing
at the Manhattan Detention Center

01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:36.803
when a man identifying himself
as Adrian Toomes

01:34:36.886 --> 01:34:40.056
simply appeared
in an otherwise empty cell.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:44.936
A hearing has been set that could likely
lead to his immediate release.

01:36:55.775 --> 01:36:57.400
Thanks for meeting me, doc.

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.112
I've been reading about you.

01:37:00.196 --> 01:37:01.280
I'm listening.

01:37:01.363 --> 01:37:02.949
I'm not sure how I got here.

01:37:03.032 --> 01:37:05.618
Has to do with Spider-Man, I think.

01:37:06.368 --> 01:37:07.995
I'm still figuring this place out,

01:37:08.079 --> 01:37:11.331
but I think a bunch of guys like us
should team up.

01:37:11.414 --> 01:37:12.625
Could do some good.

01:37:13.501 --> 01:37:14.669
Intriguing.
